You are given an integer L and a string S of L letters (lower case), 
without space. Your objective is to take some of these letters, 
put them in any order you want, and build a palindrome 
with the maximum possible length. And among 
all possible longest palindromes, 
output the one which is the smallest in lexicographic order.



Entrée
Line 1: the length L of the string
Line 2: the string S of L lower case letters, without spaces.
Sortie
A string of lower cases representing the palindrome 
made of letters from S and having the maximum length 
possible but being the smallest in lexicographic order (
    among all maximum length palindromes)
